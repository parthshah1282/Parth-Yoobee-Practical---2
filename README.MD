# NumPy Activities for Beginners

## 🧠 My Understanding

This repository contains simple NumPy exercises I completed as a beginner to learn Python programming. 

I learned how to:
- Create arrays using the NumPy library.
- Perform basic operations on arrays like multiplication and finding averages.
- Work with 2D arrays to handle data like test scores.
- Use functions like `mean()`, `max()`, and `where()` to analyze data.
- Understand the structure of arrays using shape and data types.

These activities helped me understand how powerful and fast NumPy is for working with numbers and data.
